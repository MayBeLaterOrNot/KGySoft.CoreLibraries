! Breaking change
* Compatible change
- Bugfix
+ New feature
===============================================================================

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
! v5.0.0 (alpha 2):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+ Assembly changes:
===================
+ Targeting also .NET Framework 4.7.2.
+ Targeting also .NET Core 2.0.
+ Targeting also .NET Core 3.0.
+ Targeting also .NET Standard 2.0 (some Reflection APIs throw PlatformNotSupportedException - see the documentation).
+ Targeting also .NET Standard 2.1.

! KGySoft namespace
===================
! PublicResources Class:
  ! ICollectionNongenericValueTypeInvalid method has been renamed to ICollectionNonGenericValueTypeInvalid
  ! IDictionaryNongenericKeyTypeInvalid method has been renamed to IDictionaryNonGenericKeyTypeInvalid

! KGySoft.CoreLibraries namespace:
==================================
+ New TypeNameKind enum: For the TypeExtensions.GetName method.
! DictionaryExtensions class:
  ! GetValueOrDefault<TKey, TValue, TActualValue>: Caused a functional conflict in .NET Core so this method has been
    renamed to GetActualValueOrDefault. For compatibility reasons the overload for string-object dictionaries
	has not been renamed.
  + In .NET 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 a new GetValueOrDefault<TKey, TValue> overload has been added with the same functionality
    as .NET Core has. Actually this functionality was provided by the old GetValueOrDefault<TKey, TValue, TActualValue>
	overload when TValue and TActualValue were the same.
  + New GetValueOrDefault overloads for IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<TKey, Tvalue>> instances to support also read-only
    dictionaries. The parameter type is not IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue> because that would cause ambiguity due
	to the current interface inheritance. In case of non-dictionary instances a sequential search is performed.
  + New GetValueOrDefault overloads with Func<TValue> default value factory. These are useful if the default value
    should be evaluated only if the key was not present in the dictionary.
+ Enum<TEnum> class:
  + New GetFlagsMask method
- EnumerableExtensions class: Fixing non-generic TryAddRange/TryInsertRange/TryRemoveRange/TryReplaceRange if they
  are called multiple times with generic collections of different generic argument types.
+ ObjectExtensions class:
  + The DeepClone<T> method now has an optional ignoreCustomSerialization parameter, which allows cloning even if
    the ISerializable members throw exceptions (eg. PlatformNotSupportedException in .NET Core).
! TypeExtensions class:
  ! IsGenericTypeOf method returns false if the type to check is not a constructed generic type (it could return true
    if the type and genericTypeDefinition parameters were the same generic type definition instance).
  + New GetName extension method for formatting type names in a more consistent way than Type members.
+ Range<T> struct:
  + New Deconstruct method.
  + New operators for converting from T, (T, T). Not available in .NET 3.5, .NET 4.0 and .NET 4.5 versions.

- KGySoft.Diagnostics namespace:
================================
- Profiler: Handling possible SecurityException from a partially trusted domain when determining executing directory.

! KGySoft.Reflection namespace:
===============================
+ New types:
  + ResolveAssemblyOptions enum
  + New ResolveTypeOptions enum
! Reflector class:
  ! ResolveAssembly(string,bool,bool) method:
    ! This method is obsolete now in favor of the new overloads.
    ! Earlier the method returned null if the assembly could not be resolved and tryToLoad was false, and
      threw an exception on load errors. From now on this overload returns always null if the assembly
      cannot be resolved. Use the other overloads with ResolveAssemblyOptions.ThrowError flag to throw a
      ReflectionException on resolve errors.
  + New ResolveAssembly(string,ResolveAssemblyOptions) method
  + New ResolveAssembly(AssemblyName,ResolveAssemblyOptions) method
  ! ResolveType(string,bool,bool) method:
    ! This method is obsolete now in favor of the new overloads.
    ! The bool parameters have been renamed to reflect the current behavior better. The default values have
      been adjusted to provide a better compatibility with the former behavior.
    ! Earlier the method could return null or throw an exception depending on the nature of the resolving error.
      From now on the result is always null if the type cannot be resolved. Use the other overloads with
      ResolveTypeOptions.ThrowError flag to throw a ReflectionException on resolving errors.
  ! ResolveType(Assembly,string) method:
    + A new optional ResolveTypeOptions parameter have been added.
    ! Earlier the method could return null or throw an exception depending on the nature of the resolving error.
      From now on if the type cannot be resolved the result is always null if the options parameter does not contain
      the ResolveTypeOptions.ThrowError flag (default behavior), or throws a ReflectionException if the options
      parameter contains the ResolveTypeOptions.ThrowError flag.
  + New ResolveType(string,ResolveTypeOptions) method. New main features:
    + It can be controlled whether an exception should be thrown if type cannot be resolved.
    + It can be controlled whether to use case insensitive resolving.
    + Generic parameters and open constructed generics are supported if they were dumped by TypeExtensions.GetName.
    + More consistent behavior for partial assembly matching.
+ WeakAssemblySerializationBinder:
  * OmitAssemblyNameOnSerialize property is available also in .NET 3.5.
  + New IgnoreAssemblyNameOnResolve property: Makes possible to completely ignore the assembly information even if
    it was not omitted on serialization.

* KGySoft.Resources namespace:
==============================
- ResXResourceManager: Handling possible SecurityException from a partially trusted domain when determining
  executing directory.
+ ResXResourceReader/ResXResourceWriter: Supporting every RuntimeType instance natively.

! KGySoft.Serialization namespace:
==================================
+ New types:
  + CustomSerializerSurrogateSelector class: Makes possible to customize the serialization and deserialization
    process both with the original BinaryFormatter and KGy SOFT BinarySerializationFormatter. Can be useful for
    serializing non-serializable types or deserializing changed types even across different platforms, eg.
    .NET Framework and .NET Core.
  + ISerializationBinder interface: Contains the same members as the SerializationBinder class in .NET 4.0 and
    later and allows for BinarySerializationFormatter to use the BindToName method in .NET 3.5 as well.
  + ForwardedTypesSerializationBinder class: Allows to define mappings for legacy assembly identities as well as
    using writing the legacy identity of a forwarded type. This makes possible to use the .NET Framework assembly
    identities even in .NET Core and .NET Standard, for example.
! BinarySerializationFormatter:
  ! The serialized stream is more compact than before (also meaning, not compatible with previous versions)
  ! The SerializationBinder that is set in the Binder property is not called for constructed generic types and
    natively supported types anymore. Instead, it is called for the generic type definition and the element types
    separately. To call the binder for supported non-primitive types the ForceRecursiveSerializationOfSupportedTypes
    flag can be enabled in the options.
  + Supporting runtime types natively. It was required for .NET Core/Standard that cannot serialize Type instances.
  + Supports serializing pointer fields.
  * Improving performance.
  - Some edge case issues have been fixed:
    - If different custom serialized types set the same type by string in SerializationInfo using different names,
      which were resolved to the same type, then the deserialization failed.
    - If non-sealed nested collections were serialized where the base type of an inner collection was a natively
      supported one, and an inner collection element had a derived collection type, then the actual collection type
      was ignored and the deserialized inner collection had the base element type.
! IBinarySerializable interface (behavioral change for implementations):
  ! The options parameter of the special constructor and the Deserialize methods get the options of the
    deserialization rather than the original one used for the serialization. If that info is needed you need to save
    it into the custom serialized data.
+ AnyObjectSerializerWrapper class:
  + New optional forceSerializationByFields parameter in constructor.
+ BinarySerializationOptions: New ForceRecursiveSerializationOfSupportedTypes flag.
+ BinarySerializer: Adding optional BinarySerializationOptions parameter to deserialization methods.
* WeakAssemblySerializationBinder:
  + Implements ISerializationBinder.
  + The OmitAssemblyNameOnSerialize property is available also in .NET 3.5. A BinaryFormatter still ignores this
    property in .NET 3.5 (though it does not affect functionality) but BinarySerializationFormatter is now able
    to use that in all .NET versions.
  + New IgnoreAssemblyNameOnResolve property: If assembly information is available on deserialization but the
    type cannot be resolved from that assembly, then this property allows to resolve the type from any loaded
    assemblies if possible.
* XmlSerializer:
  - Fixing array type names when XmlSerializationOptions.FullyQualifiedNames is set.
  + Supporting every RuntimeType instance natively.

+ IExpandoResourceManager:
  + New CloneValues property
  + New GetStream method
! ResXResourceManager:
  + New CloneValues property
  ! To be compatible with ResourceManager the default value of CloneValues is true, so Get[Meta]Object and Get[Meta]Enumerator will return a copy
    of the stored objects by default. For compatibility with earlier behavior set CloneValues to false.
  ! New GetStream methods: Since in the base ResourceManager these methods are not overridable these are newly defined methods.
    Unlike the base methods, these have MemoryStream return type (instead of UnmanagedMemoryStream).
! HybridResourceManager:
  ! If SafeMode is true the GetString methods do not throw an InvalidOperationException even if the result is from a compiled resource.
  + New CloneValues property
  ! To be compatible with ResourceManager the default value of CloneValues is true, so Get[Meta]Object and Get[Meta]Enumerator will return a copy
    of the stored objects by default. For compatibility with earlier behavior set CloneValues to false.

  + New protected GetObjectData and OnDeserialization methods.
  + DisposeDroppedValues property: If an item is removed from the cache internally (or a concurrently loaded item is discarded
    by an IThreadSafeCacheAccessor) and the item is IDisposable, then it can be disposed if this property is true.

+ KGySoft.Diagnostics namespace:

~~~~~~~~~
! v4.6.0:
~~~~~~~~~

! Assembly: Applying SecurityRuleSet.Level2 and adjusting security critical calls in the whole assembly.
  This is a breaking change for .NET4.0 and above only if the caller assembly is partially trusted or is

    ! Obsolete flag ForcedSerializationValueTypesAsFallback removed.
    ! BinarySerializationAsFallback is applied also for root-level collections
    * None option allows to serialize some trusted collection types and object with only public properties and fields.
    + New flag: ExcludeFields - to serialize public properties only.
    + New flag: ForcedSerializationOfReadOnlyMembersAndCollections - to serialize read-only properties and fields even if they are not
      mutable collections or IXmlSerializable instances. Enabling this flag can be used for one-way serialization only (eg. for logs),
      because it is high likely that the object will not be able to be deserialized.
